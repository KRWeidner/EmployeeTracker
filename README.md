# EmployeeTracker

## Description
This is a terminal run app designed to showcase our SQL abilities. I have created an employee database with 3 associated tables( department, roles, employee). When run, the terminal app will present the user with a series of options to edit/insert/delete into the various tables.

## Useage
The user has 11 options to choose from: 
  1. View All Departments
  2. View All Roles
  3. View All Employees
  4. Add A Department
  5. Add A Role
  6. Add An Employee
  7. Update An Employee Role
  8. Delete Department
  9. Delete Role
  10. Delete Employee
  11. Quit

The user can choose any/all of these options to view the various db tables, make new inserts, or delete rows from the tables.
